Camera synchronization for Pose2Sim, for all frames.
On lundi 02. juin 2025, 10:08:40
Project directory: /home/lea/vitpose/Pose2Sim
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization is calculated on the whole sequence. This may take a while.
All keypoints are used to compute the best synchronization offset.
These keypoints are filtered with a Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency: 6 Hz, order: 4).
They are removed when their likelihood is below 0.4.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on frames 479 to 1768 is 3.2 px, which roughly corresponds to 19238.9 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
Gaps were interpolated with linear method if smaller than 10 frames. Larger gaps were filled with the last valid value.
In average, 6.58 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera M11458 was excluded 66% of the time, Camera M11461: 63%, Camera M11139: 61%, Camera M11140: 58%, Camera M11141: 58%, Camera M11462: 58%, Camera M11459: 57%, and Camera M11463: 50%.

Camera synchronization for Pose2Sim, for all frames.
On lundi 02. juin 2025, 10:18:43
Project directory: /home/lea/vitpose/Pose2Sim
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization is calculated on the whole sequence. This may take a while.
All keypoints are used to compute the best synchronization offset.
These keypoints are filtered with a Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency: 6 Hz, order: 4).
They are removed when their likelihood is below 0.4.

Camera synchronization for Pose2Sim, for all frames.
On lundi 02. juin 2025, 10:26:51
Project directory: /home/lea/vitpose/Pose2Sim
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization is calculated on the whole sequence. This may take a while.
All keypoints are used to compute the best synchronization offset.
These keypoints are filtered with a Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency: 6 Hz, order: 4).
They are removed when their likelihood is below 0.4.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on frames 0 to 1045 is 7.6 px, which roughly corresponds to 45.7 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 20 px.
Gaps were interpolated with linear method if smaller than 10 frames. Larger gaps were filled with the last valid value.
In average, 3.96 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera M11461 was excluded 67% of the time, Camera M11463: 60%, Camera M11139: 60%, Camera M11459: 56%, Camera M11462: 53%, Camera M11140: 39%, Camera M11458: 33%, and Camera M11141: 28%.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on frames 0 to 1045 is 7.8 px, which roughly corresponds to 46.9 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 20 px.
Gaps were interpolated with linear method if smaller than 10 frames. Larger gaps were filled with the last valid value.
In average, 3.66 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera M11461 was excluded 64% of the time, Camera M11139: 60%, Camera M11463: 55%, Camera M11459: 52%, Camera M11462: 48%, Camera M11140: 34%, Camera M11458: 28%, and Camera M11141: 25%.
